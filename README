This is a rewrite of the ThinIce theme for GTK3, with the engine written in Vala.
It looks nearly identical - there are a few discrepancies, but not jarring.
GtkSwitch styling is my own invention.

DEPENDENCIES:
    gtk+-3.0
    valac (unless when a ready-made .c file is used)

COMPILING:
    make

    Non-GNU make has not been tested, but should work.

INSTALLATION:
    make install

    For packagers: to put the installed files in a tree
	under $PACKAGING_DIR, use

    make install ROOT=$PACKAGING_DIR

SOURCE TARBALL:
    make tarball

    The tarball will contain the C code, so valac will not be needed
    by whomever unpacks it.

    You will need to modify the Makefile if you use BSD tar. See inside.
